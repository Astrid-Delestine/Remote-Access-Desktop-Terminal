## Regards to the keyboard

After some thinking I think that a traditionaly laid out keyboard would be best. While I would like a detechable ergonomic keyboard I do not think it makes sense for the device to close. I might be able to get around this by having a keyboard pop in and out of place, but that introduces moving parts into the equasion, plus the keyboard is the same board I want the MU to be mounted to (the underside). Soooo ultimately its not super in the cards... but maybe in the future.

Think the lenovo butterfly keyboard but ergonomic....


anyways I think ill stick with a (atmittedly large) Alice layout combined with a 1800 style keyboard. Here is a picture of what I am thinking

I will have to figure out PCB sizes and things later, I just wanted to make sure these were *"bookmarked"*

[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ErgoMechKeyboards/comments/1huhzf9/molekula_keyboard_framework/) is another interesting keyboard design that I might look into using... at some point. NOT FOR THIS PROJECT
