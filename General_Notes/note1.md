# Note 1

The general idea for this project can be seen from the requirements page, however a more detailed brain dump can be seen here. 

The idea for these tasks is as follows

## Task 1:
The custom designed keyboard has many facets to decide. These are:
* Keycap Style
* Layout Style
* Keyboard Size
    * Full
    * Compact Full (1800)
    * TKL
    * 75%
    * 65%
    * 60%
    * 50%
    * 40%
    * Alice layout *
    * Ergo layout *
    * FULL CUSTOM
    * Otholinear *

For these I have marked the ones I want to look into more with an astrix (*)

Ensure the use of a trackpoint module

The keyboard should be hotswappable if at all possible however this will be removed if time is of the essence
